        <h3>Endogenous Experiences and Educational Games - 09/08/2024</h3>
        <p>The following is taken from a discussion post I wrote for my Intro to Game Design class, responding to the article, 
        From Content to Context: Videogames as Designed Experience, by Kurt Squire.
        </p>
        <p>Squire's article, specifically parts discussing education in games, made me think about the first video game 
            that I really remember and stuck with: Mount and Blade. A lot of the game consists of the player traversing a 
            map to different locations, and over time you become so familiar with the huge map and different nations, 
            which cities are good for which types of trading, which have the best soldiers or lords to meet, etc. I knew 
            that game inside and out, because it is endogenous and dynamic. It made me think that if a game was developed 
            with similar endogenous mechanics, but with a more traditionally, "academically useful" theme, how much I would 
            have learned. For example, if instead of managing a war band, and conversing with different lords, I was a 
            presidential candidate, traveling to different states to earn votes and converse with modern issues people 
            have. I would know the US map as well as I still know the map of Calradia! Maybe I would have learned how 
            politicians game the electoral college and min/max their presence in each state. I would have learned how they 
            manage campaign funds, or how important voting is. During elementary school on our school, I remember playing 
            an exogenous game tackling this thematic premise as a class. I remember playing it, and what it looked like, but 
            I don't remember what I learned from it, or that I learned much from it at all. Did I just find being a medieval 
            knight more interesting? Well, maybe. But I believe that mostly it was the endogenous mechanics that were more 
            appealing and long-lasting for me, rather than the theme.
