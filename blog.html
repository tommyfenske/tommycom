        <h3>PS5 Pro, Digital Media, and Owning Games - 09/10/2024</h3>
        <p>The PS5 Pro <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank">
            was announced today</a>, and I am worried about it and what it represents for the industry, coming from my 
            perspective as a physical collector, DRM-free advocate, and consumer of the medium.
        </p>
        <p>The largest issue I have with the PS5 Pro is that, for $700, it does not come with a disc drive. The "pro" 
            models, for both Sony and Microsoft, have always been additive and progressive. They don't remove features,
            until now. Microsoft has removed the disc drive from it's budget options, but their main models have always
            had them. I'm worried the PS5 Pro is indicative of the industry finally moving away from physical media, and 
            that really disappoints me. While this shift was eventually going to happen regardless, having a "pro" model 
            ship without a disc drive, and charging $80 for the add-on drive, is a serious statement. 
        </p>
        <p>Sony shifting towards digital games is concerning on its own, but it is especially harrowing after attempting 
            to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989290/playstation-digital-ownership-sucks" target="_blank"> 
            remove purchased Discovery shows from its platform</a>. Games that are purchased digitally on stores like 
            Playstation's are not yours to actually own, and they have shown that they have and will exercise the ability 
            to take them away. Until recently, my preference was to buy physical copies of games, but even having the 
            physical disc, my worries about having my right to access and play them has lead me to buy digital, DRM-free
            copies of games from stores like GOG.com and itch.io. Actually owning what you pay for is becoming a rarity 
            when it should be the standard and ideal.

        <h3>Endogenous Experiences and Educational Games - 09/08/2024</h3>
        <p>The following is taken from a discussion post I wrote for my Intro to Game Design class, responding to the article, 
        From Content to Context: Videogames as Designed Experience, by Kurt Squire.
        </p>
        <p>Squire's article, specifically parts discussing education in games, made me think about the first video game 
            that I really remember and stuck with: Mount and Blade. A lot of the game consists of the player traversing a 
            map to different locations, and over time you become so familiar with the huge map and different nations, 
            which cities are good for which types of trading, which have the best soldiers or lords to meet, etc. I knew 
            that game inside and out, because it is endogenous and dynamic. It made me think that if a game was developed 
            with similar endogenous mechanics, but with a more traditionally, "academically useful" theme, how much I would 
            have learned. For example, if instead of managing a war band, and conversing with different lords, I was a 
            presidential candidate, traveling to different states to earn votes and converse with modern issues people 
            have. I would know the US map as well as I still know the map of Calradia! Maybe I would have learned how 
            politicians game the electoral college and min/max their presence in each state. I would have learned how they 
            manage campaign funds, or how important voting is. During elementary school on our school, I remember playing 
            an exogenous game tackling this thematic premise as a class. I remember playing it, and what it looked like, but 
            I don't remember what I learned from it, or that I learned much from it at all. Did I just find being a medieval 
            knight more interesting? Well, maybe. But I believe that mostly it was the endogenous mechanics that were more 
            appealing and long-lasting for me, rather than the theme.
